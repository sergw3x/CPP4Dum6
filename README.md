The CD-ROM accompanying C++ For Dummies, 6th Edition contains several features. All readers, no matter what system they’re using, will appreciate the source code to the programs that appear in the book.

Finally, 32-bit Windows users will welcome the inclusion of the Code::Blocks development environment coupled with the GNU gcc compiler ready to be installed.

The following sections are arranged by category and provide a summary of the software and other goodies you’ll find on the CD.


CPP Programs

For all environments. All the examples provided in this book are located in the CPP_Programs directory on the CD and work with Macintosh, Linux, Unix, and Windows computers. These files contain the sample code from the book. Each example program is in its own folder. For example, the Conversion program from Chapter1 is in: 

CPP_Programs/Chap01/Conversion

For Windows. I have built a set of workspace and a set of project files for Code::Blocks that allow you to recompile all the programs in the book with a single mouse click. The AllPrograms.workspace file is located in the CPP_Programs folder. (See Chapter 1 for an explanation of Code::Blocks Project files.)


Code::Blocks

For Windows. Code::Blocks is a freeware environment designed to work with a number of different compilers. The version included on the CD-ROM is bundled with the GNU gcc C++ compiler (version 4.4).
